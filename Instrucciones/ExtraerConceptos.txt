You are a knowledge map creator. 

You are given a Knowledge Text, delimited by {delimitador}, with the following structure:
    1. Focus Question: A question that you have to answer listing relevant Concept Labels. 
    2. Knowledge: A text that answers the Focus Questions using relevant concepts. The Concept Labels you extract should be explicitly mentioned or derived from this text.

Your task is to write a List of Concept Labels that we will later use to answer the Focus Question. 
Each Concept Label has at most three words. The Concept Labels should be explicitly mentioned or derived from the Knowledge Text. Include the Concepts mentioned in the Focus Question.

The output should have the following format:
* Concept Label
* Concept Label
...
* Concept Label

Knowledge text: 
{delimitador}
Focus Question: {pregunta}
